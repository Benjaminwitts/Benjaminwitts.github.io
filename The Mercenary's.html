    <h1>De huurmordenaars!</h1>
    <p>We have four Hire-mercenary's at the moment: Jan, Cheert, Steven and Jimmy</p>
    <p>Our best recruit is Jan he has a lot of experience. He is the perfect man for killing someone quickly and quietly!</p>
    <p>We also have Cheert he's OK tho not very skilled at anything, he's the man if it doesn't need to be a clean or silent kill needless to say he will cost less than Jan</p>
    <p>Tho my fovourite is Steven he's a bit better than Cheert and is especially good with a whip, but he is known to be kinda cocky also he wil cost a bit more than Cheert</p>
    <p>And last and seartainly least we have Jimmy, let me be Frank with you we will pay you to keap him busy. I do not want him back in this office after what he did with the refridgerator we are still finding pieces of that thing in fucking sandwitches and somehow in goddamn space!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>*Some extra info about Jan He'll do Beer/Jesus for free!</p>
